# üöÄ Markdown Code Runner

`markdown-code-runner` is a Python package that automatically executes code blocks within a Markdown file and updates the output in-place. This package is particularly useful for maintaining Markdown files with embedded code snippets, ensuring that the output displayed is up-to-date and accurate.

The package is hosted on GitHub: [https://github.com/basnijholt/markdown-code-runner](https://github.com/basnijholt/markdown-code-runner)

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

When creating Markdown files with code examples, it's essential to keep the output of these code snippets accurate and up-to-date. Manually updating the output can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially when working with large files or multiple collaborators.

`markdown-code-runner` solves this problem by automatically executing the code blocks within a Markdown file and updating the output in-place. This ensures that the displayed output is always in sync with the code.

## üíª Installation

Install `markdown-code-runner` via pip:

```bash
pip install markdown-code-runner
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

To get started with `markdown-code-runner`, follow these steps:

1.  Add code blocks to your Markdown file between `<!-- START_CODE -->` and `<!-- END_CODE -->` markers.
2.  Place the output of the code blocks between `<!-- START_OUTPUT -->` and `<!-- END_OUTPUT -->` markers.

Example:

```markdown
This is an example code block:

<!-- START_CODE -->
<!-- print('Hello, world!') -->
<!-- END_CODE -->
<!-- START_OUTPUT -->
This content will be replaced by the output of the code block above.
<!-- END_OUTPUT -->
```

3.  Run `markdown-code-runner` on your Markdown file:

```bash
markdown-code-runner /path/to/your/markdown_file.md
```

4.  The output of the code block will be automatically executed and inserted between the output markers.

Usage
-----

To use `markdown-code-runner`, simply import the `update_markdown_file` function from the package and call it with the path to your Markdown file:

```python
from markdown_code_runner import update_markdown_file
from pathlib import Path

update_markdown_file(Path("path/to/your/markdown_file.md"))
```

## üìñ Examples

Here are a few examples demonstrating the usage of `markdown-code-runner`:

### üåü Example 1: Simple code block

```markdown
This is an example of a simple code block:

<!-- START_CODE -->
<!-- print('Hello, world!') -->
<!-- END_CODE -->
<!-- START_OUTPUT -->
This content will be replaced by the output of the code block above.
<!-- END_OUTPUT -->
```

After running `markdown-code-runner`:

```markdown
This is an example of a simple code block:

<!-- START_CODE -->
<!-- print('Hello, world!') -->
<!-- END_CODE -->
<!-- START_OUTPUT -->
<!-- THIS CONTENT IS AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED -->
Hello, world!
<!-- END_OUTPUT -->
```

### üåü Example 2: Multiple code blocks

```markdown
Here are two code blocks:

First code block:

<!-- START_CODE -->
<!-- print('Hello, world!') -->
<!-- END_CODE -->
<!-- START_OUTPUT -->
This content will be replaced by the output of the first code block.
<!-- END_OUTPUT -->

Second code block:

<!-- START_CODE -->
<!-- print('Hello again!') -->
<!-- END_CODE -->
<!-- START_OUTPUT -->
This content will be replaced by the output of the second code block.
<!-- END_OUTPUT -->
```

After running `markdown-code-runner`:
```markdown
Here are two code blocks:

First code block:

<!-- START_CODE --> <!-- print('Hello, world!') --> <!-- END_CODE --> <!-- START_OUTPUT --> <!-- THIS CONTENT IS AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED -->

Hello, world!

<!-- END_OUTPUT -->

Second code block:

<!-- START_CODE --> <!-- print('Hello again!') --> <!-- END_CODE --> <!-- START_OUTPUT --> <!-- THIS CONTENT IS AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED -->

Hello again!

<!-- END_OUTPUT -->
```
