# Getting Started

This guide will help you install and start using `markdown-code-runner` in minutes.

## Installation

<!-- CODE:START -->
<!-- from docs_gen import readme_section -->
<!-- print(readme_section("installation")) -->
<!-- CODE:END -->
<!-- OUTPUT:START -->
<!-- ⚠️ This content is auto-generated by `markdown-code-runner`. -->
Install `markdown-code-runner` via pip:

```bash
pip install markdown-code-runner
```

<!-- OUTPUT:END -->

You can also install with `uv`:

```bash
uv pip install markdown-code-runner
```

Or as a tool:

```bash
uv tool install markdown-code-runner
```

## Quick Start

<!-- CODE:START -->
<!-- from docs_gen import readme_section -->
<!-- print(readme_section("quick-start")) -->
<!-- CODE:END -->
<!-- OUTPUT:START -->
<!-- ⚠️ This content is auto-generated by `markdown-code-runner`. -->
To get started with `markdown-code-runner`, follow these steps:

1.  Add code blocks to your Markdown file using either of the following methods:

    **Method 1 (*show your code*):** Use a triple backtick code block with the language specifier `python markdown-code-runner`.

    Example:
    <!​-- CODE:SKIP --> <!-- This is here otherwise the next example gets executed -->
    ````markdown
    ```python markdown-code-runner​
    print('Hello, world!')
    ```
    (Optionally, you can place some text between the code block and the output markers)
    <!​-- OUTPUT:START -->
    This content will be replaced by the output of the code block above.
    <!​-- OUTPUT:END -->
    ````

    or for Bash:
    <!​-- CODE:SKIP --> <!-- This is here otherwise the next example gets executed -->
    ````markdown
    ```bash markdown-code-runner​
    echo 'Hello, world!'
    ```
    (Optionally, you can place some text between the code block and the output markers)
    <!​-- OUTPUT:START -->
    This content will be replaced by the output of the code block above.
    <!​-- OUTPUT:END -->
    ````

    **Method 2 *(hide your code)*:** Place the code between `<!​-- CODE:START -->` and `<!​-- CODE:END -->` markers. Add the output markers `<!​-- OUTPUT:START -->` and `<!​-- OUTPUT:END -->` where you want the output to be displayed.

    Example:
    <!​-- CODE:SKIP --> <!-- This is here otherwise the next example gets executed -->
    ```markdown
    This is an example code block:

    <!​-- CODE:START -->
    <!-- print('Hello, world!') -->
    <!​-- CODE:END -->
    <!​-- OUTPUT:START -->
    This content will be replaced by the output of the code block above.
    <!​-- OUTPUT:END -->
    ```

    or for Bash:
    <!​-- CODE:SKIP --> <!-- This is here otherwise the next example gets executed -->
    ```markdown
    This is an example code block:

    <!​-- CODE:BASH:START -->
    <!-- MY_VAR="Hello, World!" -->
    <!-- echo $MY_VAR -->
    <!​-- CODE:END -->
    <!​-- OUTPUT:START -->
    This content will be replaced by the output of the code block above.
    <!​-- OUTPUT:END -->
    ```

2.  Run `markdown-code-runner` on your Markdown file:

    ```bash markdown-code-runner​ /path/to/your/markdown_file.md
    ```

3.  The output of the code block will be automatically executed and inserted between the output markers.
