# Test Markdown File

This is a test Markdown file for the `markdown_code_runner` project.

## Code Block 1

Here's a simple code block:

<!-- START_CODE -->
<!-- print('Hello, world!') -->
<!-- END_CODE -->
<!-- START_OUTPUT -->
<!-- THIS CONTENT IS AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY markdown-code-runner -->
Hello, world!

<!-- END_OUTPUT -->

## Code Block 2

Here's another code block:

<!-- START_CODE -->
<!-- print('This is another code block!') -->
<!-- END_CODE -->
<!-- START_OUTPUT -->
<!-- THIS CONTENT IS AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY markdown-code-runner -->
This is another code block!

<!-- END_OUTPUT -->

That's it for this test file!
